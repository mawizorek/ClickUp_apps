# Open Memory Requests

_Public queue for memory-write candidates that an agent cannot or should not land itself. **Empty by default.** Maggie processes it on "run your thing on the open memory requests" and clears processed entries. Protocol: `brain-config/agents/memory-maggie/open-memory-request-protocol.md`._

**Two doors:**
- **DROP (any agent, mid-session):** "add that to the open memory log" → the current agent appends ONE entry below. That's it.
- **DRAIN (fresh session):** "open as Memory Maggie" → "run your thing on the open memory requests" → Maggie triages + places the whole batch, then clears it.

**How to use (any agent, Door 1):** append ONE entry under Open. Do not place it yourself, do not touch `/PREFERENCES.md`. Maggie decides where it lands.

**Placement is NOT yours to assume:** "preference" earns nothing. Deny-by-default for brain memory. Your suggested destination is a hint only. Most requests land in `brain-config/` (hooks / gates / agent profiles) or the Brain Reference Library, not in brain memory.

**Neighbors, don't mix:** this = memory-write candidates · `open-thread.md` = durable pending work · `session-board.md` = live presence.
