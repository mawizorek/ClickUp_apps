# App Version Ledger

**This file is the tiebreaker against stale reads and CDN/cache lag.** Agents read source through paths that can silently serve an old copy. This ledger is the one hand-maintained record of what version each app is actually on. When your read disagrees with this file, assume YOUR READ IS STALE and reconcile before touching anything.

## Procedure (MANDATORY on every app PR)

1. **Before opening a PR:** find the app's row below. Confirm the version/state you believe is current matches this ledger. If they disagree, STOP: re-read the real source (immutable commit-SHA path, not a branch URL) and reconcile. Do not build on a mismatch.
2. **Immediately after opening the PR:** update this app's row in the same session, bump the version, add the PR link, update the date. The ledger must never lag behind `main`.
3. This is a two-sided check: step 1 catches a stale read going in, step 2 keeps the ledger honest coming out.

Git commit history remains the authoritative changelog; this ledger is the fast human/agent-readable "where are we now" index that history alone doesn't surface at a glance.

## Ledger

| App (slug) | Current version | Status | Last PR / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prism` | v1 | live | Data App Viewer (JSON + Markdown). Initial build PR #54. |
| `app-dashboard` | v4 launcher + Retired filter | live | Slim launcher: per-app icons, ClickUp/FileMaker toggle, Brain Config hub, detail sheet, settings gear. `index.html` = thin loader over `source/` modules. Retired-status tag + "Show retired" toggle added PR #66 (additive, `source/data.js` only). Footer stamp still reads v4/PR#40 (version const lives in `app.js`, not safely editable via the flattening read path). |
| `markdown-viewer` | — | retired | Superseded by `prism`. Marked `status:'retired'` in app-dashboard data.js (PR #66); hidden by default behind the Show-retired toggle. README is a redirect/history stub. Do not develop. |
| `file-chunker` | unverified (last known v16.2, 2026-07-01) | live | Verify against commit history before next PR. |
| `budget-code-mapper` | unverified (last known v6, design) | live | Verify before next PR. |
| `f1-racetracks` | unverified (last known v4/v5) | live | Verify before next PR. |
| `world-cup-bracket` | unverified | live | Verify before next PR. |
| `pdf-splitter` | unverified | live | Verify before next PR. |
| `on-track` | unverified | live | Verify before next PR. |
| `inciardi-market` | unverified | live | Verify before next PR. |
| `filemaker` | unverified | reference | FileMaker app docs, runs in FMP (no Pages). Verify before next PR. |

**Non-app infra (not launchable apps, listed so they're not mistaken for apps):** `brain-config`, `agent-reports`, `routines`, `shared`, `quickfire`, `template-app`, `polish-demo`.

_Rollout note: `unverified` rows carry the last value I could see without a fresh read; each gets confirmed and firmed up the next time that app is touched. Confirmed rows (prism, app-dashboard, markdown-viewer) are current as of 2026-07-07._
