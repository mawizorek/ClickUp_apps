### 🧹 Brand-asset cleanup (soft, not urgent)

The icon + share banner are live and working, but shipped under their raw mobile-upload filenames because renaming wasn't possible from the phone. Tidy when convenient:

- **Rename** `IMG_4698.png` → `icon.png` (app icon) and `IMG_4689.png` → `og.png` (share/OG banner). Then update the three refs in `index.html` head (`apple-touch-icon`, PNG `favicon`, `og:image` + `twitter:image`) back to the clean names.
- **Downsize:** both are ~1+ MB straight off the phone. Target icon ~512x512 (<100KB) and banner 1200x630 (<200KB) so the OG unfurl loads fast and stays under budget.
- **Optional:** add a 192px PNG variant for best Android home-screen install fidelity, and confirm the banner is exactly 1200x630 (crop if the phone export drifted).

No rush: everything maps and renders as-is. This is polish, not a blocker.

## Known guardrails

- Data updates = commit `data.json` only, no engine bump.
- Brand asset refs live in the `index.html` head; keep the absolute Pages URL for og/twitter (relative paths don't unfurl).
